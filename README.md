- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/)

## Algorithms and Concepts
- TextRank
- [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)
- [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity)

## How to run
- Install the required libraries using pip, virtual environment or conda.
- Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.

## Objective of the Jupyter Notebook

The dataset contains long descriptions (Introduction) of products. 
The task is to make a text summariser that takes these descriptions as input and summarises them into shorter versions without loosing the context.
The length of the summary is also adjustable by the user.
